# Maze_Solver_BFSapplication
served as a quick and easy review of BFS. Logic is a bit messy as I was implementing trees in python; However, it basically uses queues and trees to traverse back and forth and to find the minimum path.

Basically finds the shortest path of any maze given that the start and end positions are defined.


Example of a test case (can be of any dimensions/design):

The result:
